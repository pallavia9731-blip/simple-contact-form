## 🧠 What I Learned
During this assignment, I learned:
* **DOM Manipulation:** How to use JavaScript to grab data from a form and inject new rows into an HTML table dynamically.
* **LocalStorage:** How to save data in the user's browser so that the list doesn't disappear when the page is refreshed.
* **Client-Side Validation:** Using JavaScript and HTML5 attributes to ensure users enter a valid email and don't leave fields empty.
* **Event Handling:** Managing the `submit` and `click` events to prevent default page reloads and handle row deletions.
* **Responsive Design:** Using CSS media queries to ensure the table and form look good on both mobile and desktop screens.
